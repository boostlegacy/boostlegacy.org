<h3>Player Conduct</h3>
<h4>Bad Manners / Player Conduct / Language:</h4>

* Boost Legacy prides itself for being a community of Rocket League players of all skill levels. Bad manners can easily ruin the experience of new or even old players of the game. However, we do understand that there will be friendly bantering.
* If there are any issues, contact a Boost Legacy moderator and we will try to resolve the issue.
* Excessive bad language, racism or unprofessional attitude may result in a DQ or ban from tournament play depending on severity.

<h4>Impersonation/Cheating:</h4>

* Impersonating another player or cheating the system in order to play will result in a ban from future tournaments. We do not allow unregistered players to compete in matches.

<h3>Tournament / Game Rules</h3>
<h4>Spectators:</h4>

* Spectators are not allowed during any matches of any series during Boost Legacy tournaments. Spectators can be allowed if both teams agree before the match starts.

<h4>Sub Players:</h4>

* Subs cannot be made during the middle of games. Each team is allowed to have a sub, but a sub can only made between games.
* All subs must be registered to the team on Smash.gg to be permitted to play.

<h4>DQ Timers:</h4>

* You have 10 minutes to start a match after both teams have finished their previous match or the tourney begins and it shows up in the bracket as ready to play. If a team is not ready within 10 minutes, Smash.gg will auto disqualify any teams who have not checked into the match.

<h4>Disconnected Players:</h4>

* Players that are disconnected in a game may rejoin the game, but a sub cannot replace the starting player until the next game in the series.

<h4>Starting matches:</h4>

* All players playing in the match must be present in the game before the starting timer hits zero. If a player joins after the starting timer the match can be restarted before the first goal is scored, with the exception of if the first goal is a kickoff goal before the other team can request a remake, it will be decided by a moderator whether this is the case.
* Where a team checks in but does not join the server in less than 5 minutes, please flag a Boost Legacy staff member as that team is subject to disqualification.

<h4>Server Remake Requests:</h4>

* In the event of a player disconnecting or a bad connection to the server where no points have been scored a remake can be requested in game.
* Each team is allowed up to one remake per series.
* After a point has been scored the remainder of the match must be played unless a tourney admin agrees to remake based upon any extenuating circumstance.

<h4>In game Bugs:</h4>

* If any serious bugs occur, the game has to be quit immediately and the match has to be re-played. If a team doesn’t agree on the rematch, a video recording of the bug is required to dispute the claim. The admin will then decide the outcome.
* Abusing a bug is forbidden.

<h4>Hacking / Third Party Tools:</h4>

* The usage of any Rocket League tool aside from Steam, PSN, Xbox and Rocket League during a match is strictly forbidden. This includes teleportation via quick disconnecting and rejoining to spawn on your side of the map.
* We encourage our teams to save replays.
* When you encounter any issue with hacking or cheating make sure you save the replay for admin and Psyonix review.
* All hacking claims will be submitted to Psyonix for further review.

<h3>Post Game Rules</h3>
<h4>Result Submission:</h4>

* The winning team is required to submit the match result on the match page. Saving a screenshot of the match scoreboard after the game was finished, is strongly recommended but optional. Keep these in case of a dispute in the scoreboard.
* The losing team has to confirm the match result submitted by the winning team on the match page.
* Submitting wrong or false match results, not confirming a correct match result is strictly forbidden and punishable.

<h4>Screenshots:</h4>

* It is recommended that players take screenshots and save replays of every game you play in the series as this will help significantly in the case of a score dispute.
* Typically we do not require team to upload the screenshots, but when necessary they can be uploaded directly to Smash.gg after the matches have been played. Details are available in the Game Dashboard when reporting match scores.  

<h3>Other Rules</h3>
<h4>Broadcasting/Streaming:</h4>
