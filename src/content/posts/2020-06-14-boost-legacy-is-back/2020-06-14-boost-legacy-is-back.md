After a short haiatus Boost Legacy is coming back to bring you more Rocket
League events!

## Our History
Boost Legacy began with the name Ghostboosters in 2015 as a community of Rocket
League players looking to have fun playing the game with other players in the
community. Soon after formation we began hosting small 2v2 tournaments just for
the fun of competition. These tournaments had players hanging out in voice chats
having a blast meeting new people and playing for an extravagent prize pool of
$20. Over time as the competitive scene grew we consistently provided weekly
tournaments and started expanding to multiple formats. With these changes we
rebranded as Boost Legacy and went all in as a tournament organizer. Over the
years and hundreds of tournaments the more professional tournament scene began
to put a strain on our volunteer staff and as many of us moved on to different
chapters of our life we couldn't put the attention to detail and effort that the
competitive community deserved. This leads us to where we are now.

## So What Now?
Many of us long for those early days of Rocket League when we could pick up a
controller and laugh and have fun as we whiffed the ball spectacularly. This
early joy is why we have such a love for the game and commit countless hours to
it. We hope to bring back some of that sense of fun with monthly community
events.

In the next couple of weeks we will be announcing our first monthly event. The
goal will be to bring people together and to interact with the community. We
are going to start off with a familiar event format but plan on bringing in new
ideas over the coming months. While these events will have a competitive nature
they will be primarily focused towards having fun in a relaxed community
friendly environment.

We look forward to hanging out once again.
